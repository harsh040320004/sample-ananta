  <h3>Our Mission and Vision</h3>
<p>
 The vision behind Ananta was to create a unique identity of the university. <br>
        Ananta is also a representation of the ideologies of the university which are inherited <br>
         and initiated by the students of the university to create the ultimate event of the university <br>
         once in a year. The aim of Ananta was to bring all the students from various disciplines <br>
          on a common platform and bring the vibrancy back in the university after halts produced due to covid. <br>
